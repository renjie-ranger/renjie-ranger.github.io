I am currently a Ph.D. student at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), supervised by [Prof. Wei Lu](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei), focusing on Large Language Model Post-training and Reasoning. I am also an Associate Member at Sea AI Lab, supervised by Chao Du and Tianyu Pang.

I graduated from Beihang University with a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence Engineering (GPA: 3.64/4.0) in June 2024. During my undergraduate studies, I gained extensive research experience through internships at top institutions and companies.

My research interests primarily focus on **Large Language Model Post-training and Reasoning**, including reinforcement learning-enhanced fine-tuning for mathematical reasoning, long chain-of-thought training for small language models, and comprehensive evaluation frameworks for LLMs. I am passionate about developing more effective training strategies and evaluation methodologies to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models.

I have published several papers at top-tier conferences including ACL 2024, with notable works on OlympiadBench (a challenging benchmark for AGI evaluation) and UltraEval (a comprehensive evaluation platform for LLMs). My work has received significant attention from the research community, with citations reaching hundreds.

I am fluent in multiple languages: Chinese (Native), English (Fluent, IELTS 7.5/9), Japanese (Intermediate), and Cantonese (Advanced).
