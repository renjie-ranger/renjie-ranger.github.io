I am currently a Ph.D. student at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), supervised by [Prof. Wei Lu](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/profile/lu-wei), focusing on Large Language Model Post-training and Reasoning. I am also an Associate Member at Sea AI Lab, supervised by [Chao Du](https://duchao0726.github.io) and [Tianyu Pang](https://p2333.github.io).

My research interests primarily focus on **LLM Post-training and Reasoning**. I am passionate about developing more effective training strategies to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models.
